# BlackScholes

### Summary:
This project is to develop a dashboard to be used for options trading. When creating strategies and opening options position, knowing the risks you are exposed to is crucial to avoiding 'surprise' portfolio drawdowns.

One often overlooked type of risk comes in the form of option greeks, espcially higher-order greeks like Charm or Color.

We will also look at some of the differences in scores between different genres, as well as different platforms. These trends could help game developers to learn more about the state of the video game industry at various points throughout the past 20 years, and apply this knowledge to what they're seeing today, in order to make more educated decisions when deciding on projects to invest in. Another interesting aspect of this is the "Console vs. PC" rivalry, and so we can see which platform truly has the better games (according to IGN).

Overall, I hope to be able to utilize more critic and community ratings from the IGDB database to augment this analysis, however I am still working on my wrapper for their API, and so was unable to use it for this release.
